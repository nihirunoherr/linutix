Linutix kernel
============

Linutix is a simple fork of the Linux kernel that merges pull requests from torvalds/linux.

FAQ

Is Linutix automated?
No, the PRs merged from torvalds/linux are handpicked.

Why does Linutix exist?
It is not uncommon for inexperienced kernel devs to submit PRs to the rovalds/linux Github repo not knowing that
the Linux kernel is not developed on Github. This project aims to merge those PRs alongside the up-to-date Linux
kernel, resulting in an improved kernel, quicker.

What is the practical difference?
There are plenty of differences "under-the-hood", but the experience is mostly identical to the end-user.
If you use Linux, and switch to Linutix, you will not see any noticable changes.

Can I contribute?
By it's nature, Linutix cannot be "contributed" to.
